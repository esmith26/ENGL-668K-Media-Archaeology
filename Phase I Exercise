There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 
•	What operating system does it run? 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)
The power switch was on the back right side of the computer.  My biggest problem with starting WordStar was that I didn't understand at first that you needed to close the flap on Drive A after you insert the floppy disk.  I find the keyboard template very confusing and have mostly succeeded in typing gibberish rather than commands.

APPLE IIe

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)
The on button is on the lower left front of the computer.  I was unable to manipulated the joystick for Sea Dragon after I completed the tutorial. If I have time, I plan on coming back later to give either that game or another one a shot.

MACINTOSH SE

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?
The on switch was on the back left side of the computer. Marble Springs is so interesting; I love that it will let you add marginal commentary, and even your own poems, if none currently exist for a character.  In addition to Marble Springs, there is StorySpace, some screensaver software, "moon to Deena," which is in itself a StorySpace file, and Note Pad. There is also a program called Scrapbook, which allows the user to "build a graphics library" and "store [their] favorite sounds." There is also something called "We Descend" that, when I selected it, there was not enough memory to open. There is an alarm clock, a calculator, and a puzzle listed under the Apple menu.

VECTREX

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?
The on button is the dial at the bottom right front of the screen.  I played MineStorm and then the StarTrek game.  I think they likely opted for the vector graphics because they mimic the graphics of real radar used at the time, thereby allowing the gamer to feel as though he or she is operating a 'real' spaceship without photorealism in the images.

AMIGA

•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.
On button was on the left side of the computer, monitor power at the front of the screen, bottom right.  I put in Workbench 1.2 and tried the Demos.  On Amiga Appetizer I found "Write," "Tile," "Music," and "Paint" programs, as well as "Documents," "Pictures," "Songs," and "Instruments" (where creations from those earlier programs seem to be stored). I actually really enjoyed the little Tile game.  I think it's interesting that the "storage" unit here, which we might conceptualize as a folder, is a drawer.  The cursor looking more like a human hand (and making a "Zzz" graphic rather than a watch or an hourglass while things are loading) is also interesting.

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? 
•	What operating system does it run? 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?
The on button is at the upper right of the keyboard.  I was disarmed that both this and the other Mac have indents on the D and K keys as opposed to the F and J; I kept misplacing my hands on the keyboard.  I prefer WordPerfect; I find the menu cleaner (i.e. I can just check or uncheck a box to make the ruler appear or disappear). I actually might prefer both of these to the modern Word in some ways, as frequent functions are not buried in menus, but are instead very accessible just above the text window.  Also on this Mac are Excel, ML Publisher, PageMaker, MacLabelPro, and MacDraw (in addition to some of the basic features that were also present on the other Mac: the Scrapbook, etc.).  We can see the previous users' (Allan and Linda's) old files, including material pertaining to National History Day, National Library Week, and an advertisement for the documentary The War Within: A Portrait of Virginia Woolf.  There is also an Excel sheet with Pizza orders and--perhaps most alarmingly--one of Allan's saved label projects lists his address in Bowie.

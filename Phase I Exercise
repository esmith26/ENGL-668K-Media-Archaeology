There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot?

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 
It was released in 1984.  
•	What operating system does it run? 
It runs CP/M.  
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
When it was released, it cost $3500 ($8015 in today's dollars).  They are less available than some other Kaypro models on the secondhand market (ex: the Kaypro II), but are still relatively common.    
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
It had a larger screen than its competitors, and its software package, including WordStar and the Perfect suite (PerfectWriter, PerfectCalc, PerfectFiler, and PerfectSpeller) was superior to other models on the market. Its design was critiqued; a 1986 article remarked that the previous Kaypro models had essentially been packaged in tin cans. Another weakness was that it was still running CP/M after MS-DOS had begun to take over as the dominant OS.  It was best known for the software package and for the industrial, "rugged" Kaypro look.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)

The power switch was on the back right side of the computer.  My biggest problem with starting WordStar was that I didn't understand at first that you needed to close the flap on Drive A after you insert the floppy disk.  I found the keyboard template very confusing and mostly succeeded in typing gibberish rather than commands. This was the computer I struggled with the most, as the method of inputing commands was so different from what I am used to in typing documents.  I had trouble figuring out exactly what this computer may be able to do that mine cannot primarily because I am still not entirely sure what I managed to make the Kaypro do in the first place.

APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 
It was released in January 1983. 
•	What operating system does it run?
Apple IIes could run both Apple DOS 3.3 and ProDOS.  
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
When it was released, it cost $1395 ($3332 in today's dollars).  I found a number of eBay auctions for Apple IIes, though rather fewer on Craiglist; ultimately, they seem relatively straightforward to obtain on the secondhand market.  
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
It had a full ASCII character set and keyboard, it lowered production costs, and had a cleaner motherboard design.  It was easier to plug in game and input devices than in previous models, making it a popular model for those interested in gaming. It was also very compatible with earlier Apple software. Its main weakness upon its debut was its high price, but otherwise, it was a very much praised, and remained on the market for eleven years, essentially until Apple's Macintosh line eclipsed the Apple II series altogether.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)
The on button is on the lower left front of the computer.  After I completed the tutorial, I loaded Sea Dragon; I'm a big fan of the audio it plays on the title screen.  I was really fascinated by the tutorial, and frankly wish that those kinds of immersive tutorials existed on every modern computer; its metaphors and explanation for certain types of error messages would be easier than what I feel is the current method of computer education: "This is what you do.  If you get an error message, you did something wrong. Go back and do something else."  I also imagine this tutorial was very helpful (and indeed necessary) for people for whom this was their first home computer.  The tutorial actually resulted in a very interesting phone conversation with my mother where she described transfering over from using computers that filled whole rooms when she was in grad school and doing her typing on typewriters to, later, using home computers.

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 
It was released in March of 1987.  
•	What operating system does it run? 
Mac OS. 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
When it was released, the version with dual floppy drives cost $2900, and the version with a 20 MB hard drive cost $3900 ($6074 and $8168 in today's dollars, respectively).  They seem relatively rare on the secondhand market; eBay only turned up 47 hits, and Craigslist was even more challenging to find it on. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
It was considered very portable, and it was considered more reliable and longer-lived than its predecessors, particularly the Macintosh Plus. It was notable for having the ability for expansion cards, such as accelerators, to be installed; hence "SE" (System Expansion). I had trouble finding documentation on the weaknesses, but some I noticed are its small screen display and occasional difficult getting in and out of programs (though that may also be a StorySpace problem).  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?
The on switch was on the back left side of the computer. Marble Springs is so interesting; I love that it will let you add marginal commentary, and even your own poems, if none currently exist for a character.  I had trouble articulating some of the other things I liked about Marble Springs and StorySpace until Emerson describes them in Reading Writing Interfaces: the networking system of hypertext in StorySpace is in many ways richer than the "links" I'm used to, and while there are drawbacks (I got pretty far down a rabbit hole of the story and had trouble finding my way back to where I was), the complexity of the interconnections was astounding--and, as Larsen uses it to represent the history of a community, hits on some of my deeply-held research interests on cultural memory and the way we tell stories about ourselves and our communities. I could go on for several more paragraphs, but long story short, discovering StorySpace and works made with it were hands-down my favorite things about this exercise.  
In addition to Marble Springs, there is StorySpace, some screensaver software, "moon to Deena," which is in itself a StorySpace file, Bill Bly's "We Descend" on StorySpace, and Note Pad. There is also a program called Scrapbook, which allows the user to "build a graphics library" and "store [their] favorite sounds." There is an alarm clock, a calculator, and a puzzle listed under the Apple menu.

VECTREX

•	What year was it made? 
It was released in November of 1982.  
•	What operating system does it run? 
Since it is a video game console, it does not run the same sort of operating systems as the other computers.  Instead it simply comes with the built-in game of MineStorm and allows other cartridges to be inserted and played.  
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Upon its released, it cost $199 ($470 in today's dollars).  There are definitely some available on the secondhand market, although not a great deal of them.  
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
It has been praised for its durability, controller design, and library of games.  Also, its vector graphics allowed it to replicate the visuals of many popular arcade games of the day--it was the first and only home-based system to use a vector-based screen.  Its main weakness upon its release was the unfortunate proximity of that release to the video game market crash of 1983.  In my use of it, I found the the button controllers a bit hard to figure out (how long to hold them, etc.) and was surprised that the dial to turn it on also controls the volume, but I imagine those 'weaknesses' may not have registered with contemporary users who would have been more familiar with systems like this.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?
The on button is the dial at the bottom right front of the screen.  I played MineStorm and then the StarTrek game.  I think they likely opted for the vector graphics because they mimic the graphics of real radar used at the time, thereby allowing the gamer to feel as though he or she is operating a 'real' spaceship without photorealism in the images.  I remarked to another student in MITH that I had had trouble finding the dial to turn the machien on at first, because I am so unused to dials on devices; she had had a similar experience, remarking that it was like old televisions and even (to some extent) rotary phones.  That remark really helped contextualize why dials seemed so unfamiliar to me: because they were part of a functional aesthetic of technology that preceded my using those tools.  Not being much of a gamer myself (I've always prefered watching the graphics to actually playing video games), I actually preferred this to some modern games I've seen simply because of its simplicity.  I can handle pushing some buttons and moving a joystick, whereas I am frequently alarmed and frustrated by sequences of buttons one is required to press in modern games.

AMIGA

•	What year was it made? 
It was released in July 1985
•	What operating system does it run? 
Amiga OS on Kickstart
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Upon its release, it cost $1295 ($2863 in today's dollars).  I found several on eBay, though it does not seem that the monitor and the computer itself are often sold together, so perhaps that makes it a bit rarer than several other computers on this list regarding the secondhand market.  
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
Its ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it very useful in music and video producton/editing.  It is understood retrospectively to have been the first multimedia computer, though at the time, it was considered merely a 'game machine,' as its graphics, sound, and video features were not appreciated.  It was also cheaper than contemporary home computer alternatives, but failed to compete with later PCs with multimedia features, hence the demise of its producing company, Commodore.  

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.
On button was on the left side of the computer, monitor power at the front of the screen, bottom right. Since I've been working on laptops for so much of my life, it was actually slightly surprising to me that I had to turn each of these on separately.  The separation between monitor and computer was also borne out in my researches for several of these models on secondhand markets, where often the monitors are sold separently.  On the Amiga, I put in Workbench 1.2 and tried the Demos.  On Amiga Appetizer I found "Write," "Tile," "Music," and "Paint" programs, as well as "Documents," "Pictures," "Songs," and "Instruments" (where creations from those earlier programs seem to be stored). I actually really enjoyed the little Tile game.  I think it's interesting that the "storage" unit here, which we might conceptualize as a folder, is a drawer.  I tried to articulate to another student in MITH why that conceptual metaphor struck me as important, and all I managed to say is that "it's somehow literally deeper," but I suppose that's my point.  Drawers imply a physical space and possibility for subdivisions that folders do not, and also in some way a structural strength that one does not associate with folders. I think in some ways, I would prefer if modern computers had maintained this set of organizational metaphors. The cursor looking more like a human hand (and making a "Zzz" graphic rather than a watch or an hourglass while things are loading) is also interesting.  I have seen cursors that look like hands before, but those were shaped like white gloves, whereas the orientation of this one looks like a physical hand being held up to whatever you are clicking on, a sort of humanizing gesture.

MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? 
It was released in September 1989.  
•	What operating system does it run?
It is able to run several iterations of the Mac OS.
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
Its debut cost was $6269 (a staggering $12,000 in today's money).  I found several on the secondhand market, but not very many; it seems it is rarer than other Mac models.  
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
It was best known for being a business "workhorse," one of the most popular and longest lived computers in the Mac line.  It was generally understood to have improved upon previous models, though a major weakness was its lack of compatibility (having improved upon its predecessors so much as to outpace them).  It came with built in and stereo audio.  Overall, it was lauded as a powerful, cutting-edge computer in a small, easily accessible case.  Fittingly, since this was the most "modern" computer, I found it most accessible to work on and most 'recognizable,' given my previous frame of reference.  As detailed below, there are actually programs on this Mac that I prefer to the versions of those programs as they now exist.   
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?
The on button is at the upper right of the keyboard.  I was disarmed that both this and the other Mac have indents on the D and K keys as opposed to the F and J; I kept misplacing my hands on the keyboard.  I prefer WordPerfect; I find the menu cleaner (i.e. I can just check or uncheck a box to make the ruler appear or disappear). I actually might prefer both of these to the modern Word in some ways, as frequent functions are not buried in menus, but are instead very accessible just above the text window.  Also on this Mac are Excel, ML Publisher, PageMaker, MacLabelPro, and MacDraw (in addition to some of the basic features that were also present on the other Mac: the Scrapbook, etc.).  We can see the previous users' (Allan and Linda's) old files, including material pertaining to National History Day, National Library Week, and an advertisement for the documentary The War Within: A Portrait of Virginia Woolf.  There is also an Excel sheet with Pizza orders and--perhaps most alarmingly--one of Allan's saved label projects lists his address in Bowie.
